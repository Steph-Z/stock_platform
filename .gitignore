# Visual Studio Code
#   Visual Studio Code specific template is maintained in a separate VisualStudioCode.gitignore 
#   that can be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/VisualStudioCode.gitignore
#   and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file. However, if you prefer, 
#   you could uncomment the following to ignore the entire vscode folder
